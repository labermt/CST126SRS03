# CST126SRS03
Elephant


Class ID: Seadra and Mespirit

SRS ID: CST126SRS03

Unresolved Issues: Elephant cant reach herd if there is no path to the herd then program will enter infinate loop.
					Infinate loop is caused if rock is to the east of the herd, and south of the herd, when elephant approaches from the east. (reciprical also causes loop)
